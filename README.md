# Tailwind CSS Project

This is a basic setup for a new project using Tailwind, a CSS post-processor utility class. Tailwinds helps make styling web documents easy, intuitive, and customizable. For more information refer to the official [Tailwind CSS site](https://www.tailinwindcss.com).

Setting up a project like this is relatively easy, and there is a [great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HuwjmuS7A&list=PL7CcGwsqRpSM3w9BT_21tUU8JN2SnyckR&index=1) on YouTube.

As recommended in the above tutorial, using live-server to run the project can be helpful. Installing it globally is easy and can be done by running `npm install -g live-server` from command line. Run it from within the project directory with the command `live-server public`.
